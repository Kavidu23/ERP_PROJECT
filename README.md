## 📌 Project Overview

This project addresses inefficiencies in the OPD patient registration and receipt-issuing process by designing a new **to-be process** and a supporting **system prototype**. We replaced manual and redundant tasks with an efficient **Smart Card & Token system**, optimized queue flow, and introduced digital support for medical staff.

## 🔄 As-Is vs To-Be Process (BPMN 2.0)

### 🔹 As-Is Process (Current)

- Manual receipt issuance
- Barcode scanning errors
- Long queues & doctor counter congestion
- Redundant data entry in books and systems

### 🔸 To-Be Process (Redesigned) (BPMN 2.0)

- Smart Card or Token with QR Code for identification
- Queue manager to reduce congestion
- Doctor dashboard with profile & report access
- AI-assisted report review

## 💻 System Overview

A **prototype system** (not a working app) designed to:

- Register new patients and issue Smart Cards
- Scan QR codes to guide patients to correct counters
- Help doctors view patient profiles and upload prescriptions
- Store all patient data, reports, and decisions centrally
